I.  Swift/Cloud Files Driver Production Setup Instructions

1. In deuce/tests/test_swift_storage_driver.py, replace auth_url with the correct value.

    auth_url = 'Auth URL'

2. Run Pecan command to start the service.

    pecan serve config.py



II.  Swift/Cloud Files Driver Testing Instructions

1. In deuce/tests/test_swift_storage_driver.py, replace auth_url with the correct value.

    auth_url = 'Auth URL'

2. In deuce/storage_credentials.json, replace username and password with the correct values of the Deuce user.

    "username": "Your user name",
    "password": "your password"

3. In deuce/tests/__init__.py, replace these 3 lines, to active the real swiftclient module.

Before

    conf_dict['block_storage_driver']['swift']['swift_module'] = \
        'deuce.tests.db_mocking.swift_mocking'
    conf_dict['block_storage_driver']['swift']['is_mocking'] = True

After

    conf_dict['block_storage_driver']['swift']['swift_module'] = \
        'swiftclient'
    conf_dict['block_storage_driver']['swift']['is_mocking'] = False


4. Run tests with the storage in Rackspace Cloud Files.


** If tests fail with driver.delete_vault(), the problematic vault and the garbage inside it need to be deleted manually from the control panel.
