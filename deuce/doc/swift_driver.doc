Swift /Cloud Files Driver Testing Instructions

1. In deuce/tests/test_swift_storage_driver.py, replace these 3 lines with correct values.

    auth_url = 'Auth URL'
    username = 'User Name'
    password = 'User Password'

2. In deuce/tests/__init__.py, replace these 3 lines

    conf_dict['block_storage_driver']['swift']['swift_module'] = \
        'deuce.tests.db_mocking.swift_mocking'
    conf_dict['block_storage_driver']['swift']['is_mocking'] = True

with 

    conf_dict['block_storage_driver']['swift']['swift_module'] = \
        'swiftclient'
    conf_dict['block_storage_driver']['swift']['is_mocking'] = False


3. Run tests with the storage in Rackspace Cloud Files.


** If tests fail with driver.delete_vault(), the problematic vault and the garbage inside it need to be deleted manually from the control panel.
